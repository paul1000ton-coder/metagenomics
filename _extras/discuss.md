Nanopore sequencing is third generation, it is characterized by the generation of long reading fragments without the need of PCR amplification. Here is a workflow for this specific sequencing technology: [Workflows and tutorials for LongRead analysis with specific focus on Oxford Nanopore data](https://timkahlke.github.io/LongRead_tutorials/).

## Comparative chart between Ilumina and Nanopore 

|  Characteristic | Illumina          | Nanopore                                |
